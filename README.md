# ShoppingCart

This project helps with splitting the bill between friends. It is a simple command line application that takes in the total amount of the bill, the number of people splitting the bill, and the names of the people splitting the bill. It then calculates the amount each person should pay.

## Run

To use this project, you can clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py <optional path>
```

The optional path is the path to a file that contains the bill information. The file should be in the following format:

```
<marker(s)>-<item name>-<price>
```

An example is available in the test directory
